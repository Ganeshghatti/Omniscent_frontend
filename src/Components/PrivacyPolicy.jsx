      HOW DOES OMNISCIENT PERSPECTIVES PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION? Whenever we
      obtain customers’ Personal Information and Sensitive Personal
      Data/Information, we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect it
      from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, we are not insurers of
      the security of customer information. Accordingly, we assume no liability
      for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized
      third-party access, or other acts of third parties, or acts or omissions
      beyond our reasonable control. Security: The security of customers’
      Personal Information is important to us. When customers enter sensitive
      information on our registration or other forms, we encrypt that
      information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow
      generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information
      submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However,
      no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
      acceptable means to protect Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
      absolute security. Internet-based Transfers: Using the Internet to collect
      and process Personal Information necessarily involves the transmission of
      data. By providing Omniscient Perspectives with Personal Information, the
      customer acknowledges and agrees that we may store Personal Information
      and transfer it to and from our servers located on the internet. We
      endeavour to protect all Personal Information collected through the
      Website in a safe, confidential, and secure manner. 4.2 DOES THIS PRIVACY
      POLICY APPLY WHEN ACCESSING THIRD PARTY WEBSITES? Customers may be able to
      access third party websites directly from the Website. This Privacy Policy
      does not apply when customers access third party websites. We cannot
      control how third parties may use Personal Information customers disclose
      to them, so customers should carefully review the privacy policy of any
      third-party website before using it or disclosing Personal Information to
      its provider. 4.3 OPTING OUT FROM RECEIVING COMMUNICATIONS FROM OMNISCIENT
      PERSPECTIVES? We provide customers the opportunity to opt-out of having
      their Personal Information used for certain purposes. For example, if
      customers do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us
      or if they no longer wish to receive our newsletters and promotional
      communications, they may opt-out of receiving them by following the
      instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing
      us at contact@omniscientperspectives.in. If we plan to disclose customer
      Personal Information to a third party in a manner that is not set forth in
      this Privacy Policy, the Customer will be notified so that the Customer
      can make an informed choice about sharing Personal Information with that
      third party.
